<h1>Sport Trippin — Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 26, 2026</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Sport Trippin ("the App") is a sports trip planning application. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect and how we use it.</p>

<h2>Data We Collect</h2>
<p><strong>Location Data (Optional):</strong> If you grant permission, the App accesses your device location solely to center the map near you. Location data is processed on your device and is not transmitted to our servers or any third party.</p>
<p><strong>No Account Required:</strong> The App does not require account creation, login, or any personal information to use.</p>
<p><strong>No Analytics or Tracking:</strong> The App does not use analytics SDKs, advertising frameworks, or tracking technologies.</p>

<h2>Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
<p>We do not collect, store, or share any of the following: names, email addresses, phone numbers, payment information, browsing history, device identifiers, or any other personally identifiable information.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The App retrieves publicly available sports schedule data from third-party APIs to display game information. These requests do not include any user personal data.</p>
<p>Map tiles are provided by Apple Maps (on iOS) and OpenStreetMap (on web). Their respective privacy policies apply to map tile requests.</p>

<h2>Data Storage</h2>
<p>Trip selections are stored locally on your device only. No user data is stored on our servers.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>The App does not knowingly collect any data from children under 13. Since we collect no personal data from any user, the App is compliant with COPPA.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected on this page with an updated effective date.</p>
